# E2E Coverage Matrix

This matrix tracks user-visible actions across roles/views and maps each action to Playwright coverage.

Legend:
- `Covered`: action has deterministic assertion-backed test coverage
- `Partial`: action is covered, but with loose/flaky assertions or helper bypasses
- `Missing`: no direct assertion-backed E2E coverage yet
